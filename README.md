# common-selenium-test-ng

This is the common test API for training purpose

WEB Testing:
 - The test case inherits from the BaseWebTest which will cover help to engage with driver for execution
 - The inside page objects inherits from Page which will init the element on the construction

API Testing
 - The test case inherits from the BaseAPITest which will keep the specification for re-use with the relevant login-token
 - The API which wrap the endpoint to actions (simulate the POM on API testing)

Hope you can understand well the ideas,
GOOD LUCK
